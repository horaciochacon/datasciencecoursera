# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - 2019

## Overview

This is the repository for the coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project". The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the student's ability to read raw data and transform it in tidy and ready to analyze format.

## The Dataset

The dataset used for this assignment is called "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" and the complete information can be found in the following [link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). It comprises measurements from smartphones accelerometers performed during different activities (walking, standing, laying, etc.)
